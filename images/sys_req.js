ux = `Unreal Engine has also had a facelift. The previous user interface of UE 4 is also quite easy on the eyes. However, the interface is also a bit classic because it was released 10 years ago. Now with UE5’s release, the new editor is smart, sleek and Functions and features are far easier to use; the introduction of a Create tab, more support for plugins (especially Quixel and Substance), a more streamline launcher and an improved content browser system.`
lighting = `In Unreal Engine 5, lighting is dynamic (or real time) by default. In UE4, a similar feature, raytracing, could be integrated, but only with a powerful enough graphics card and processor. With Lumen, all lighting is automatically real time and optimized.
For example ray tracing to work in UE4. Ray tracing setup requires changing project settings, lighting expertise. Moreover, manually adding lighting to a scene is simply one step in the process of creating realistic lighting, rendering ray tracing in UE4 unusable for video games due to its high CPU cost. On the other hand, in UE5, Lumen can operate on a new PC. You can use UE5 for ray tracing and real time, highly realistic lighting.`
modelling = `Finally, modeling, sculpting and UV unwrap tools have now been added. The Modelling Mode in Unreal Engine 5 enables fast deformation and customization using a wide range of transformers and tools. In addition, users can also use the Landscape, Foliage, Mesh Paint, and Animation modes in addition to modeling, as well as a brush editing mode created just for the Mesh Paint function.`


global_illumination = `Lumen is Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system that is designed for next-generation consoles, and it is the default global illumination and reflections system. Lumen renders diffuse interreflection with infinite bounces and indirect specular reflections in large, detailed environments at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers.
Lumen brings robust dynamic global illumination to Unreal Engine and integrates well with other supporting systems in Unreal Engine 5, such as Nanite, World Partition, and Virtual Shadow Maps.`

sky_lighting = `Sky lighting is solved as part of Lumen's Final Gather process. It includes sky shadowing, allowing indoor space to be much darker than outdoor lighting, providing a much more natural effect.`

reflections = `Lumen solves indirect specular, or reflections, for the full range of material roughness values. Diffuse global illumination and shadowed skylight can be seen in all reflections. Lumen Reflections also support Clear Coat materials.`
